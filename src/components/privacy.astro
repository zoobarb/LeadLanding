          Insurance for Locals Leads Privacy Policy and Purchase Agreement
Affective May 2024
The terms and conditions (“terms”) herein are a legal, binding agreement between Happy Agent Leads and you, receiving the services from us or via our site (“Agent” or “you”). Your acceptance of the terms here is required for your use of the site and any of our services, and to our provision of leads to you. By clicking “Accept”, which represents your electronic signature on the terms, you accept these terms. You accept that your interaction with the website and each request you make for our services is subject to the terms here. If you disagree with any of the terms here, don’t use our services.
Leads Purchase
You agree to purchase leads in line with the guidelines here. A lead will contain information that has been provided by a person as well as certain lead contact information as available, unless otherwise agreed by you and us in writing, such as: (a) first and last name, (b) phone number, (c) email address, and (d) mailing address. Happy Agent Leads doesn’t guarantee the quality or adequacy of the leads that are offered to you.
You’ll be charged for the leads based on the price stated at the time of the purchase, and fees may differ from purchase to purchase at any time. We do our absolute best to begin delivering leads between 24 – 72 hours, but because we are dependent on Facebook’s approval of our campaign, it may take up to 10 days to deliver an order. However, in some cases, orders can experience slight delays owing to daily supply and demand market conditions on the Social media platforms we advertise on. In such a rare case, you will be notified and your leads will be delivered in a timely manner.
Purchases of leads are not cancellable, and there is no refund on fees paid. You’re not authorized to use any services that are not paid fully for.
You may reject a lead for a replacement within 7 days of receipt if: (i) the lead person over 85 or under 50; (ii) the lead is over a 50 mile radius of their given city or zip code; (iv) the lead is a duplicate of another lead we have offered for the same requested services that are generated by the same person (i.e., the leads includes the same name, phone number, address, and email address).
All replacement leads are delivered from the same territory as your order that requires replacements leads.
Authorized Use and Purpose of Leads
Leads are rendered on a 100% Exclusive basis per agent.
