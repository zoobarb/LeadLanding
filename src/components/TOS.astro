          Terms of Service
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600">
          Terms and Conditions/Purchase Agreement The terms and conditions
          (“terms”) herein are a legal, binding agreement between Happy Agent
          Leads and you, receiving the services from us or via our site (“Agent”
          or “you”). Your acceptance of the terms here is required for your use
          of the site and any of our services, and to our provision of leads to
          you. By clicking “Accept”, which represents your electronic signature
          on the terms, you accept these terms. You accept that your interaction
          with the website and each request you make for our services is subject
          to the terms here. If you disagree with any of the terms here, don’t
          use our services. Leads Purchase You agree to purchase leads in line
          with the guidelines here. A lead will contain information that has
          been provided by a person as well as certain lead contact information
          as available, unless otherwise agreed by you and us in writing, such
          as: (a) first and last name, (b) phone number, (c) email address, and
          (d) mailing address. Happy Agent Leads doesn’t guarantee the quality
          or adequacy of the leads that are offered to you. When you place an
          order with us, you are 'opting in' to receive SMS text messages and
          Emails with your lead's information. By placing an order, you agree to
          receive text message and emails from Happy Agent Leads. You will
          receive a text message and email per every lead generated. You may
          unsubscribe at any time by responding STOP to our texts and clicking
          the 'unsubscribe' like at the bottom of your emails. You’ll be charged
          for the leads based on the price stated at the time of the purchase,
          and fees may differ from purchase to purchase at any time. We do our
          absolute best to begin delivering leads between 24 – 72 hours, but
          because we are dependent on Facebook’s approval of our campaign, it
          may take up to 10 days to deliver an order. However, in some cases,
          orders can experience slight delays owing to daily supply and demand
          market conditions on the Social media platforms we advertise on. In
          such a rare case, you will be notified and your leads will be
          delivered in a timely manner. Purchases of leads are not cancellable,
          and there is no refund on fees paid. You’re not authorized to use any
          services that are not paid fully for. You may reject a lead for a
          replacement within 7 days of receipt if: (i) the lead person over 85
          or under 50; (ii) the lead is over a 50 mile radius of their given
          city or zip code; (iv) the lead is a duplicate of another lead we have
          offered for the same requested services that are generated by the same
          person (i.e., the leads includes the same name, phone number, address,
          and email address). All replacement leads are delivered from the same
          territory as your order that requires replacements leads. Authorized
          Use and Purpose of Leads Leads are rendered on a 100% Exclusive basis
          for a particular purpose for which the consumer submitted the online
          form (“the specific vertical”), for instance, life insurance. You’re
          allowed to use the leads provided by us exclusively for your internal
          marketing purposes in the specific vertical to the consumers. You may
          not use the lead for purposes other than those that the consumer has
          expressly inquired about, or of third parties. Agents can’t
          redistribute or sell our leads. Leads are confidential information of
          Happy Agent Leads. You agree to not share with others, distribute,
          license, sell, resell or otherwise disclose any of the leads or the
          information included in them, to any third party for any purpose,
          unless only to an entity employed by you as a contractor for the main
          purpose of assisting you under the terms here as well as in accordance
          with the authorized use of the leads by you. When leads are generated,
          we don’t guarantee any certain results. A lead is a prospect, so don’t
          regard it as a guaranteed sale. All leads delivered over 50 miles are
          replaced. Service Usage It is solely your responsibility to know about
          all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the access, use,
          storage and security of data identifying consumers that we offer to

          commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural controls,
          care and protection to protect any such consumer information received
          under the terms herein from any unauthorized use or disclosure,
